Content Summary:
This is the webpage content retrieved from {url}. In actual implementation, this would include:
- Webpage title
- Main text content (converted to Markdown format)
- Important links
- Image descriptions

Note: This is a mock implementation. For actual use, you need to install packages like requests, beautifulsoup4 and implement real webpage scraping functionality.

Suggested dependencies:
- requests: for HTTP requests
- beautifulsoup4: for HTML parsing
- html2text: for converting to Markdown format
